# Spam SMS Classifier.

The increased number of unsolicited emails known as spam has necessitated the
development of increasingly reliable and robust antispam filters. Recent machine learning
approaches have been successful in detecting and filtering spam emails.

This model aims to predict whether an email is spam or not spam (ham). The dataset consists of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam).
